# ðŸ“¦ Barcode Smart Contract Architecture

This document explains the components involved in the **Barcode Smart Contract** system and how they interact.

---

## 1. ðŸ–¥ User Application
**Purpose:**  
Acts as the primary interface for end-users to scan or input barcodes.

**Key Functions:**
- Capture barcode data via scanner or camera.
- Display product and transaction details to users.
- Send data securely to the backend for processing.
- Trigger smart contract interactions (e.g., product verification, ownership transfer).

## 2. ðŸ”— Backend
**Purpose:**  
Serves as the bridge between the user-facing application and the blockchain network.

**Key Functions:**
- Process incoming barcode data from the user application.
- Validate and sanitize inputs before passing them to the smart contract.
- Manage **API** endpoints for different operations (query, write, update).
- Handle responses from blockchain to send back to the user.

## 3. ðŸ“¡ API Layer
**Purpose:**  
Provides the structured communication method between backend services and smart contracts.

**Key Functions:**
- Define standard request/response formats for transactions.
- Implement authentication and authorization.
- Connect backend logic with blockchain transaction methods.

---

## 4. ðŸ¤– Smart Contract
**Purpose:**  
An immutable program deployed on the blockchain that enforces the system's rules.

**Key Functions:**
- Store and verify product information tied to barcode identifiers.
- Record and transfer asset ownership.
- Ensure trust by executing rules transparently without intermediaries.

---

## 5. â›“ Blockchain
**Purpose:**  
Distributed ledger ensuring data integrity, transparency, and security.

**Key Functions:**
- Record all barcode-related transactions permanently.
- Prevent tampering or fraud through cryptographic security.
- Allow public or permissioned verification of product history.

## ðŸ“ˆ Data Flow Summary
1. User scans barcode in **User Application**.  
2. **Backend** processes the data and calls the **API Layer**.  
3. API sends a transaction to the **Smart Contract**.  
4. Smart Contract records or retrieves information from the **Blockchain**.  
5. Response flows back to the user for confirmation or results.

## ðŸ›  Example Use Cases
- Supply chain tracking
- Product authenticity verification
- Automated warranty claims
- Ownership transfer for digital/physical assets
